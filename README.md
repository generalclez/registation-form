# IMGC Registation_Portal
I developed a responsive registration portal for the "Image and Glory Conference." This portal included a single-file structure with hidden pages, enabling users to advance after completing required information. I used JavaScript validation to enhance user input. The portal was designed to function seamlessly on all devices.

## Introduction
I worked on the client-side development of a registration portal tailored for the "Image and Glory Conference." This portal, in addition to its multi-page functionality and user-friendly experience, was meticulously crafted to be highly responsive across all devices. It featured a single file with multiple hidden pages, allowing users to progress to the next page only after filling in the required information. I employed JavaScript validation with EventListener functions to ensure user input met the necessary criteria, all while ensuring a seamless and visually appealing experience on various devices. This project exemplified my expertise in creating an interactive and fully responsive registration system.
